# Changelog

All notable changes to unmicro, the Dev7 / Micro (`.cryptedmicro`) decryptor.

## 3.8.1

First published build of the 3.8 changes. The `v3.8` tag was created from an
earlier, partial merge (before the cross-format key fix and the updated
recovered-key table), so the full 3.8 set ships under this version instead.
No code changes from 3.8 as merged; same license.

## 3.8

Recovers the newer AES-GCM `.cryptedmicro` format alongside the original
AES-ECB one.

### Added
- **AES-256-GCM decryption.** Newer `!micro` builds write
  `salt(16) | iv(12) | ciphertext | tag(16)`, keyed by
  PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 over the typed key (UTF-8), 600,000 rounds, 256 bits.
  Works on every back end: `cryptography`, `pycryptodome`, and the built in
  pure-Python AES (with its own GHASH), so a bare interpreter still runs it.
  Large files are streamed in 1 MiB chunks, and no plaintext leaves the GCM
  path until the tag has verified.
- **Per-file format detection.** Both formats share the extension. Files whose
  length cannot be ECB go to the GCM search; block-aligned files go through
  the ECB search, and those it cannot open, or that a GCM key from the same
  machine opens, are treated as GCM. One machine with both formats, or
  several keys of each, is handled in one run. A key found on either format
  is also tried on the other, since the same typed key can be reused across
  builds.
- **GCM key search.** Supplied keys, wordlist, recovered operator keys,
  scavenged strings and (with `--brute`) recovered key variants, across all
  worker processes. A hit is a tag match, so there are no false positives.
  Each found key is then mapped across the remaining files in parallel, and
  the derived keys are cached so the write pass does not run PBKDF2 again.
- **Self-test** now checks PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 against the RFC 7914 vector and
  AES-256-GCM against NIST test case 15 on both the active back end and the
  pure-Python one, and confirms a corrupted tag is rejected. Still no license
  needed.

- **Sealed recovered-key table updated** with newly recovered operator keys.
  Same license as 3.7; the table is still only readable with it.

### Unchanged
- The original AES-ECB path: decryption, key search, GPU brute, checkpoints
  and verification behave exactly as in 3.7. ECB-only machines see no
  difference except that files which cannot be ECB are no longer swept as ECB.

### Notes
- The fitted model, structural brute and GPU are not run against GCM files.
  At 600,000 PBKDF2 rounds a guess costs roughly 0.2 seconds per core, so an
  open-ended search there is not practical. `--checkpoint` covers the ECB
  search only; the GCM tiers are bounded.
- The built in AES gained a forward block function, used only as GCM's
  counter-mode keystream. The tool still has no code that computes a tag or
  writes ciphertext, so it still cannot produce a `.cryptedmicro` file.

## 3.7

Per-build license key, so the recovered-key list stops riding in the public
binary.

### Added
- **Per-build license key.** The recovered-key list, operator handles, Turkish
  vocabulary, keyboard layouts and actor notes are sealed with AES-256-CBC +
  HMAC-SHA256 under a license key that is distinct for each release. The tool
  reads the key from `--license KEY`, from the `UNMICRO_LICENSE` environment
  variable, or from an interactive prompt. If you do not have a key for your
  build, contact **recon@rho-9.com** and mention "Chattering Magpies"; Rho-9
  sends one back once your case is confirmed.
- **`--self-test`.** Confirms the sealed blobs survived PyInstaller
  (SHA-256 over the ciphertext bytes), confirms the AES back end can decrypt a
  known vector, and cross-checks the back end against the built in pure-Python
  AES on a random block. Does not require a license. This is the CI smoke
  test.
- **`--list-keys`.** Prints the recovered operator keys this build knows
  about. Requires the license, so a copy of the binary alone cannot be grepped
  for them.

### Changed
- Pure-Python AES-256 is now reused for the sealed-blob unseal as well
  (CBC built on the existing ECB primitive), so the tool runs on a bare
  interpreter end to end, with no new dependencies and no encrypt path. The
  "unmicro cannot produce a .cryptedmicro file" invariant is unchanged.
- CI smoke test switched from `--list-keys` (which never shipped) to
  `--self-test`, so building this repo does not need the license secret.

### Why
The Chattering Magpies rotate their key choices once Rho-9 publishes new
recovered ones, which stops this tool from opening the next round of victims'
files. Taking the key list out of the public binary keeps the gang reading
only what Rho-9 chooses to publish on its own channels, not what is sitting
ready to grep inside this tool. The license key is rotated at every release;
victims who already have a key for a previous build get the new one with
their case, same channel.

### Notes
- Key is per build. Rebuilding the tool against a new license is an offline
  step at Rho-9; the shipped tool itself still has no encrypt path.
- A wrong license fails the HMAC verify in constant time and refuses to
  unseal; nothing is partially decrypted and no cleartext is cached.
- The licensing is a social-engineering friction layer, not a cryptographic
  secret-sharing scheme: anyone who gets a key can read the tables that build
  exposes. Rotation is how we handle that.

## 3.6

GPU throughput for the structural brute.

### Added
- **On-device structural brute for `--gpu`.** The bottleneck for GPU
  acceleration was feeding it: one Python thread produces only a few hundred
  thousand candidates a second. Now, for `--dumb-brute`, the GPU generates the
  candidates itself, each work item turns its index into a candidate over the
  alphabet, builds the key, decrypts, and checks the magic table in-kernel,
  writing back only hits. The structural brute runs at device speed instead of
  Python speed. Correct multi-byte (Turkish) handling; a second self-test
  (`mask_selftest`) requires the GPU's hit set to equal the CPU's over the same
  candidates before the device is trusted, on top of the raw-AES self-test.
  The fitted-model tier stays on the CPU.

### Changed
- CPU sweep chunk size raised (65,536) to cut per-dispatch overhead on
  many-core machines.
- The `--dumb-brute` length gate now sizes the "too long" wall against GPU
  throughput when `--gpu` is active.

### Notes
- GPU runs from the Python source (`pip install pyopencl numpy` + your GPU's
  OpenCL runtime). The released binary is CPU-only by design: victims rarely
  have a GPU or an OpenCL runtime, and bundling it would bloat the binary and
  raise antivirus false positives. GPU is the operator's cracking path.
- Developed without a GPU in CI. The kernel AES and the index-to-candidate
  brute are verified against a reference implementation; the OpenCL execution
  is validated by the on-device self-tests at run time.

## 3.5

Recovery, guessing throughput, and file naming.

### Added
- **Extension repair** after decryption. The crew randomises file extensions
  before encrypting (a video named `.jpg`, an archive named `.png`), so unmicro
  now reads each recovered file's true type from its decrypted bytes and, on a
  genuine cross-category mismatch, writes the output under the corrected
  extension and reports the swap. Conservative: container families (docx/zip,
  mov/m4a, wav/webp) and same-category names are left alone. Uses the `filetype`
  library when present, an internal table otherwise. On by default; `--no-fix-ext`
  disables it.
- **`--scavenge FILE`** (repeatable). Pull candidate keys out of an unencrypted
  dump: a memory image, the pagefile or hibernation file, a `strings` listing,
  an implant log. The key is a typed string and often survives there in the
  clear. ASCII and UTF-16LE.
- **`--dumb-brute`**. Classic incremental brute, 3 characters up to the longest
  recovered key, over the alphabet these operators type. `--charset`
  {observed, turkish, full}, default `turkish` (Turkish + English lowercase and
  digits). Pauses and explains before a length that would take too long.
- **`--checkpoint FILE`**. Save sweep progress and resume, skipping finished
  tiers and fast-forwarding the current one. Keyed to the files; matches the
  tier by name so it resumes across flag changes.
- **`--gpu` and `--gpu-info`** (experimental). OpenCL sweep for NVIDIA and AMD.
  Key derivation stays on the CPU; the device runs a startup AES self-test
  against the CPU back end and disables itself on any mismatch; every GPU hit is
  re-validated on the CPU. It can make the search faster or not engage; it
  cannot make it wrong or miss a key. Developed without a GPU in CI, so the
  OpenCL execution is validated by the on-device self-test.
- **Full-auto**: a bare `python3 unmicro.py` searches every drive, tries every
  route, and writes to `./unmicro-recovered`.

### Changed
- **`--workers` defaults to every CPU core** (was 1). Set `--workers 1` for a
  single process.
- **Bounded-memory sweep.** The candidate de-duplication is capped
  (`--seen-cap`, default 1,000,000) and cleared at the cap rather than growing
  without bound, which fixes an out-of-memory kill deep into a `--brute` run.
  De-duplication stays exact, so no candidate is skipped.

### Notes
- No change to the cryptography: AES-256 is not attacked. Recovery still rests on
  the tiny keyspace (no KDF) and known-plaintext verification.
- This tool only decrypts. It cannot produce a `.cryptedmicro` file. Your
  encrypted files are never modified, renamed or deleted.

## 3.2

- Baseline released build: autodiscovery, recovered operator keys, the fitted
  key model (`--brute`/`--deep`), structural verification of every recovery, and
  multi-key handling for interrupted encryption runs.
